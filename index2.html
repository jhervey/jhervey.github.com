				<BLOCKQUOTE style= "font-family:helvetica;color:dimgrey;text-align:justified;line-height: 150%;"> Hello RampUp! My name is John Hervey. I'm a 21 year old from Framingham, Massachusetts, currently residing in Boston. Here, I'm a senior at Boston University's School of Management, where I'm concentrating in Finance and Entrepreneurship. I got really interested in the entrepreneurial scene around a year ago, and just finished my very first internship at startup this past summer. While there, my fascination with design led me to work on a lot of user testing, and suggest design improvements that would make the site more usable. The problem was my lack of web skills prevented my from being able to implement any of these proposed changes. As I look to start a career soon, I'm realizing that having basic technical skills will come in handy in our increasingly web-based world. And yes, this is a douchey photo.</BLOCKQUOTE>
